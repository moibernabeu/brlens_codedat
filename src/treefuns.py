    Root the tree according to a rooting dictionary

    The tree is rooted with a dictionary containing species-to-age information,
    the farthest sequence from an species in the tree which has maximum age is
    selected to be the outgroup of the tree.

    Args:
        tree (PhyloTree): ete3 PhyloTree object with a get_species_tag function

        root_dict (dictionary): a dictionary containing the species age,
        indexes refers to the phylome.
        Eg.: 3: {'SP1': 1, 'SP2': 2}
        Where 3 is the phylome number and the SP2 is older than SP1.

        string: the outgroup sequence and the tree object is rooted without
        being returned.
